**IMPORTANT: This project has been deprecated, please use [`minna-ui`](https://github.com/WeAreGenki/minna-ui), a new UI framework which is based on the next-gen version of `@wearegenki/ui`. It follows our decision at We Are Genki to transition our projects from [Vue](https://vuejs.org) to [Svelte](https://svelte.technology).**

# @wearegenki/ui

A friendly UI framework which aims to be straightforward, intuitive, and high performance.

**NOTE:** This is a meta-package which pulls in all the other @wearegenki/ui packages. It's convenient for quick prototyping but we recommended installing the specific package/s you need or at least a JS framework specific meta-package. See the [main README](https://github.com/WeAreGenki/ui/blob/master/README.md) for more info.

## Child meta-packages

| NPM Package | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| `@wearegenki/ui-vue` | Vue components and CSS. |
| `@wearegenki/dev` | Development configs. |
| `@wearegenki/test` | Generic test suite with puppeteer. |
| `@wearegenki/test-vue` | Vue specific test suite. |
