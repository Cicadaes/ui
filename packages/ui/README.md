# @wearegenki/ui

FYI this is a meta-package which pulls in all the other @wearegenki/ui packages. It's convenient for quick prototyping but we recommended installing the specific package/s you need or at least a JS framework specific meta-package, e.g. `@wearegenki/ui-vue`, `@wearegenki/ui-marko`, or `@wearegenki/dev`.
