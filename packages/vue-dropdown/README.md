# @wearegenki/vue-dropdown

TODO: Write me!

Part of [@wearegenki/ui](https://github.com/WeAreGenki/ui) — a friendly UI framework which aims to be straightforward, intuitive, and high performance.

NOTES:

* You may be wondering "what's the difference from `@wearegenki/vue-input-select`?"
  * The purpose of `vue-input-select` is to be like a native `<select>` element but with a better user experience and a more sexy look. It's for displaying a list of options and allowing the user to filter and select them. You bind a v-model to the component and the selected option is output as the value.
  * This `@wearegenki/vue-dropdown` component, on the other hand, is intended to be a generic way to display content in a "dropdown" format. A typical use case may be a list of links for a menu, such as a "right click"/context menu. This component doesn't take a v-model value but instead has a slot for the developer to provide its content.
* The slot content may be anything but a list works best (and comes with some built in styles).
