# @wearegenki/vue-directive-tooltip

TODO: Write me!

Part of [@wearegenki/ui](https://github.com/WeAreGenki/ui) — a friendly UI framework which aims to be straightforward, intuitive, and high performance.

NOTES:

* Adds a class to the element which sets styles that may break the layout/flow — it needs to taken into account.
* It may be requied to use `class="tooltip-fix"` on elements where tooltip rendering is incorrect.
* Need to add `z1` class to element if tooltip is behind other elements.
