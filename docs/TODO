* Create a docs website generator
  * Something like https://docusaurus.io but more simple
  * Which framework (if any)?
  * Fun change to do something interesting
* Create a base site
* Design a custom minimal theme (using the framework, obviously)
* Create a way to transform markdown into a format that can be consumed by the site
  * Come up with a file/dir naming convention to generate site pages and sections
  * Markdown is great for devs who want to read the docs as plain text and can be easily transformed for use on the actual site too
* Create a docker image for easy site deployments
* Publish the site
