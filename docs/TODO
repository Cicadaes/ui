* Create a docs website generator
  * Something like https://docusaurus.io but more simple
  * Static site generator -- could we leverage Hugo?
  * Should support versioning, search, i18n?
  * Which framework (if any)? Hyperapp? Vue? Svelte?
  * Should be zero-conf but allow changing colours etc. via a simple config file
  * Fun chance to do something interesting
  * We have a placeholder for "docs-maker" on npmjs
* Create a base site
* Design a custom minimal theme (using the framework, obviously)
* Create a way to transform markdown into a format that can be consumed by the site
  * Come up with a file/dir naming convention to generate site pages and sections
  * Markdown is great for devs who want to read the docs as plain text and can be easily transformed for use on the actual site too
* Create a docker image for easy site deployments
* Publish the site
