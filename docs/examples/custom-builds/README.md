# Custom CSS Builds

This example covers a full _standalone_ custom CSS build workflow. A similar setup can be used for builds with a JavaScript bundler like Webpack or Rollup — replace `postcss-cli` with your bundler specific postcss runner, e.g. `postcss-loader` or `rollup-plugin-postcss`.

## Usage

Install this project's dependencies (on the command line, in this directory):

```bash
npm install
# OR
yarn
```

### Development

Compile the CSS then watch for and rebuild on changes:

```bash
npm start
# OR
yarn start
```

### Production

Compile all the CSS:

```bash
npm run build
# OR
yarn run build
```

## Instructions

TODO: Write me! This section should explain ALL the things!
