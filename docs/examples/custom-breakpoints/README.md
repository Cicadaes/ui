# Custom Breakpoints

By default the framework only comes with small/s and large/l breakpoints but it's easy to add new breakpoints or to change the existing ones.

## Instructions

See code and comments in the `_variables.css` file for details of how to implement custom breakpoints.

The code in `_variables.css` should be put in your local custom variables file. See the [custom-builds example](../custom-builds) for more information.

For more information about breakpoints and responsiveness see [the documentation](../responsiveness.md).
