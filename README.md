## Browser compatibility

Because this framework uses [CSS Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) it's limited to [browsers that support it](http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid), which currently include:

* Chrome for Android 61
* Android browser 56
* iOS Safari 10.3
* Chrome 57
* Firefox 52
* Safari 10.1

_NOTE: Older browser compatibility via progressive fallback is planned and will be added in the near future._
