# @wearegenki/ui

A futuristic UI framework which aims to be straightforward and intuitive. Intended to be used in Vue or Marko projects.

_NOTE: This is currently a work in progress and not recommended for production applications... unless you love living on the bleeding edge!_

## Overview

TODO: Write a nice readme :)

Features:

* semi-flat design
* microinteractions
* Vue components
* Marko components
* high performance
* great developer experience

## Usage

```bash
yarn add @wearegenki/ui
```

## Browser compatibility

Because this framework uses [CSS Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) it's limited to [browsers that support it](http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid), which currently include:

* Chrome for Android 61
* Android browser 56
* iOS Safari 10.3
* Chrome 57
* Firefox 52
* Safari 10.1
* Edge 16
* Opera 46

_NOTE: Older browser compatibility via progressive fallback is planned and will be added in the near future._

## Known issues

Builds are designed to run on *nix systems and will likely fail on Windows machines.
